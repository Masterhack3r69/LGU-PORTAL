# Manual Payroll Processing System Update Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement a dynamic allowance and deduction system for the manual payroll processing feature.

## Overview of Changes

We've updated the manual payroll processing system to use dynamic allowance and deduction types from the database instead of hardcoded values. This allows for more flexibility in managing employee compensation.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

- Added `allowances_breakdown` and `deductions_breakdown` JSON columns to the `payroll_items` table
- Created migration scripts to update existing database schema

### 2. Frontend Updates

- Replaced card-based employee display with a table that supports row selection
- Added filter/search functionality to the employee table
- Implemented dropdown menus for adding custom allowances and deductions
- Added action buttons for processing payroll and viewing payroll receipts
- Updated the UI to support processing multiple employees at once

### 3. Backend Updates

- Modified the `calculateManualPayroll` function to handle dynamic allowances and deductions
- Updated the `processManualPayroll` function to store breakdown information
- Enhanced the payroll processing logic to properly store dynamic allowances and deductions

### 4. Type Definitions

- Updated TypeScript interfaces to support new dynamic fields

## Files Modified

### Frontend Files
- `frontend/src/pages/ManualPayrollPage.tsx` - Main page implementation
- `frontend/src/types/payroll.ts` - Type definitions

### Backend Files
- `backend/controllers/payrollController.js` - Controller logic
- `backend/scripts/modify_payroll_items_for_dynamic_allowances_deductions.sql` - Database schema update
- `backend/scripts/update_payroll_items_with_dynamic_breakdown.sql` - Additional schema update

## Features Implemented

1. **Table-based Employee Display**: Replaced cards with a table that supports row selection
2. **Filter/Search**: Added search functionality to quickly find employees
3. **Dynamic Allowances/Deductions**: Ability to add custom allowances and deductions through dropdown menus
4. **Multi-employee Processing**: Support for selecting and processing multiple employees
5. **Payroll Receipts**: View detailed breakdown of processed payroll items
6. **Database-driven Configuration**: Uses allowance and deduction types from the database

## How to Apply Changes

1. Run the database migration scripts:
   ```sql
   -- Run modify_payroll_items_for_dynamic_allowances_deductions.sql
   -- Run update_payroll_items_with_dynamic_breakdown.sql
   ```

2. Deploy the updated frontend and backend code

3. The system will now automatically use the dynamic allowance and deduction types from the database

## Benefits

- More flexible payroll processing
- Easier to maintain allowance and deduction types
- Better user experience with table-based interface
- Support for custom allowances and deductions
- Detailed payroll receipts for transparency

## Testing

The system has been tested to ensure:
- All existing functionality continues to work
- New dynamic features work as expected
- Database schema changes are applied correctly
- User interface is responsive and user-friendly
