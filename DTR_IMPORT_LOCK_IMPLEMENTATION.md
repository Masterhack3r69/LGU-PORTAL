# DTR Import Lock Implementation

## Overview
Implemented protection to prevent DTR data from being modified after payroll has been processed. This ensures data integrity and prevents accidental changes to finalized payroll calculations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Payroll Management Page (`frontend/src/pages/payroll/PayrollManagementPage.tsx`)

#### A. Conditional Import Button Display
The "Import DTR" and "Re-import DTR" buttons are now only visible when the period status is "Draft" or "Open":

```typescript
{(selectedPeriod.status?.toLowerCase() === "draft" ||
  selectedPeriod.status?.toLowerCase() === "open") && (
  <Button onClick={handleImportDTR} variant={dtrStats?.hasImport ? "outline" : "default"}>
    <Upload className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
    {dtrStats?.hasImport ? "Re-import DTR" : "Import DTR"}
  </Button>
)}
```

#### B. Lock Warning Alert
Added an informative alert that displays when DTR import is locked:

```typescript
{selectedPeriod.status?.toLowerCase() !== "draft" &&
  selectedPeriod.status?.toLowerCase() !== "open" && (
    <Alert>
      <Lock className="h-4 w-4" />
      <AlertTitle>DTR Import Locked</AlertTitle>
      <AlertDescription>
        DTR data cannot be modified because payroll has been {status}.
        To make changes, you must reopen the payroll period first.
      </AlertDescription>
    </Alert>
  )}
```

### 2. DTR Import Page (`frontend/src/pages/payroll/DTRImportPage.tsx`)

#### A. Period Status Validation
Added validation in the `loadPeriod` function to check period status before allowing import:

```typescript
const status = foundPeriod.status?.toLowerCase();
if (status !== 'draft' && status !== 'open') {
  setError(
    `DTR import is not allowed for ${foundPeriod.status} periods. ` +
    `The payroll has already been processed. Please reopen the period if you need to make changes.`
  );
  setPeriod(foundPeriod);
}
```

#### B. Error Display
If a user tries to access the DTR import page directly (via URL) for a processed period, they see:
- Clear error message explaining why import is blocked
- The period status that's preventing import
- Instructions to reopen the period if changes are needed
- "Back to Payroll Management" button to navigate away

## Status-Based Access Control

### Allowed Statuses (Can Import/Re-import):
- ✅ **Draft** - Initial state, no processing done
- ✅ **Open** - Period is open for data entry

### Blocked Statuses (Cannot Import/Re-import):
- ❌ **Processed** - Payroll calculations completed
- ❌ **Finalized** - Payroll locked and ready for payment
- ❌ **Paid** - Payment released to employees
- ❌ **Completed** - Period fully closed

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Normal Import Flow
1. User selects a Draft/Open period
2. "Import DTR" button is visible and enabled
3. User can upload and import DTR data
4. After processing, import button disappears

### Scenario 2: Attempting Re-import on Processed Period
1. User selects a Processed/Finalized/Paid period
2. Import button is hidden
3. Lock warning alert is displayed
4. User sees clear message about why import is blocked
5. User can view DTR records but cannot modify

### Scenario 3: Direct URL Access to Import Page
1. User navigates to `/payroll/dtr-import?periodId=X` for a processed period
2. Page loads and checks period status
3. Error alert is displayed with explanation
4. Upload form is not rendered
5. User can only navigate back to payroll management

## Benefits

### 1. Data Integrity
- Prevents accidental modification of processed payroll data
- Ensures calculations remain consistent after processing
- Protects finalized payroll from unauthorized changes

### 2. Audit Trail
- Maintains accurate record of when DTR was imported
- Prevents confusion about which data was used for calculations
- Supports compliance and audit requirements

### 3. User Guidance
- Clear visual indicators (hidden buttons, lock icons)
- Informative error messages
- Guidance on how to make changes (reopen period)

### 4. Workflow Enforcement
- Enforces proper payroll processing workflow
- Requires deliberate action (reopening) to modify processed data
- Prevents accidental data corruption

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Validation
- Status checks in UI components
- Conditional rendering of import buttons
- Error state management
- User-friendly error messages

### Backend Protection
The backend already has protection in place (from `backend/services/dtrService.js`):
```javascript
// Prevent re-import if payroll is finalized (Completed or Paid)
if (payrollStatus === 'Completed' || payrollStatus === 'Paid') {
    return {
        success: true,
        data: {
            canReimport: false,
            requiresWarning: false,
            preventionReason: 'payroll_finalized',
            payrollStatus,
            lastImport,
            message: 'Cannot re-import DTR. Payroll has been finalized for this period.'
        }
    };
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Import button hidden for Processed periods
- [x] Import button hidden for Finalized periods
- [x] Import button hidden for Paid periods
- [x] Import button visible for Draft periods
- [x] Import button visible for Open periods
- [x] Lock warning displays for processed periods
- [x] Direct URL access blocked for processed periods
- [x] Error message is clear and helpful
- [x] View DTR Records button still works for all statuses
- [x] Navigation back to payroll management works
- [x] Period information displays correctly in error state

## Future Enhancements

1. **Reopen Period Feature**: Add UI to allow authorized users to reopen periods
2. **Permission-Based Access**: Allow certain roles to override the lock
3. **Audit Logging**: Log attempts to access locked periods
4. **Notification**: Notify users when they try to access locked periods
5. **Bulk Operations**: Prevent bulk operations on locked periods
