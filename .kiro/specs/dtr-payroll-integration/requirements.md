# DTR (Daily Time Record) Module - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Daily Time Record (DTR) module that integrates with the existing payroll system. The DTR module will replace the manual employee selection and working days adjustment process with an Excel-based import system that automatically populates attendance data for payroll processing.

The system will enable administrators to export employee templates, populate them with attendance data from the company's attendance system, and import the data back into the payroll module for automated payroll calculation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: DTR Template Export

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to export an employee template with employee numbers, so that I can populate it with attendance data from our company's attendance system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin accesses the payroll period processing page THEN the system SHALL display an "Export DTR Template" button
2. WHEN the admin clicks "Export DTR Template" for a specific payroll period THEN the system SHALL generate an Excel file containing:
   - Employee Number (from `employees.employee_number`)
   - Employee Name (full name concatenated)
   - Position (from `employees.plantilla_position`)
   - Period Start Date (from `payroll_periods.start_date`)
   - Period End Date (from `payroll_periods.end_date`)
   - Total Working Days (empty column for data entry)
3. WHEN the template is generated THEN the system SHALL only include active employees (where `employment_status` = 'Active' AND `deleted_at` IS NULL)
4. WHEN the template is downloaded THEN the file SHALL be named in the format: `DTR_Template_[Year]_[Month]_Period[Number]_[Timestamp].xlsx`

### Requirement 2: DTR Data Import

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to import DTR data from an Excel file, so that employee attendance is automatically loaded into the payroll system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin accesses the payroll period processing page THEN the system SHALL display an "Import DTR" button
2. WHEN the admin clicks "Import DTR" THEN the system SHALL open a file upload dialog accepting Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
3. WHEN the admin selects a file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure
4. IF the file structure is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the import
5. WHEN the file is valid THEN the system SHALL parse the Excel data and validate each row
6. WHEN parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a preview showing:
   - Total records found
   - Valid records
   - Invalid records with specific error messages
   - Warnings for records that will be skipped
7. WHEN the admin confirms the import THEN the system SHALL process all valid records and store them in the `dtr_records` table

### Requirement 3: Employee Matching

**User Story:** As an admin, I want the system to match DTR records to employees using employee numbers, so that attendance data is accurately linked to the correct employees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes each DTR record THEN it SHALL match employees using the `employees.employee_number` field
2. IF an employee number in the Excel file does not exist in the system THEN the system SHALL:
   - Mark the record as invalid
   - Add a warning message: "Employee number [X] not found in system"
   - Skip the record without failing the entire import
3. IF an employee number exists but the employee is not active THEN the system SHALL:
   - Mark the record as a warning
   - Add a warning message: "Employee [X] is not active (status: [status])"
   - Allow the admin to decide whether to include or exclude the record
4. WHEN all records are processed THEN the system SHALL display a summary of matched, unmatched, and skipped employees

### Requirement 4: Working Days Validation

**User Story:** As an admin, I want the system to validate working days data, so that only accurate attendance information is imported.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system validates a DTR record THEN it SHALL check that the "Total Working Days" field contains a valid decimal number
2. IF the working days value is not a number THEN the system SHALL mark the record as invalid with error: "Invalid working days value"
3. IF the working days value is negative THEN the system SHALL mark the record as invalid with error: "Working days cannot be negative"
4. IF the working days value is zero THEN the system SHALL mark the record as a warning with message: "Working days is zero"
5. WHEN the working days value is a decimal (e.g., 0.5, 10.5) THEN the system SHALL accept and store it with up to 2 decimal places
6. IF the working days value exceeds the maximum possible days in the period THEN the system SHALL mark the record as a warning with message: "Working days ([X]) exceeds period duration ([Y] days)"

### Requirement 5: Payroll Period Alignment

**User Story:** As an admin, I want DTR records to align with the correct payroll period, so that attendance data is processed for the appropriate pay period.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin imports a DTR file THEN the system SHALL require selection of a target payroll period
2. WHEN the system validates each DTR record THEN it SHALL compare the record's start_date and end_date with the selected payroll period's dates
3. IF the DTR record's start_date does not match `payroll_periods.start_date` THEN the system SHALL:
   - Mark the record as invalid
   - Add error message: "Start date mismatch: Expected [period_start], Found [record_start]"
   - Not include the record in the current import
4. IF the DTR record's end_date does not match `payroll_periods.end_date` THEN the system SHALL:
   - Mark the record as invalid
   - Add error message: "End date mismatch: Expected [period_end], Found [record_end]"
   - Not include the record in the current import
5. WHEN date mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL allow the admin to:
   - Remove the mismatched records from the import
   - Cancel the import and correct the source file
   - View which records have date mismatches before confirming

### Requirement 6: DTR Data Storage

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want DTR data stored separately from payroll items, so that we maintain a clear audit trail and can reprocess payroll if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN valid DTR records are imported THEN the system SHALL store them in a new `dtr_records` table
2. WHEN storing DTR records THEN the system SHALL capture:

   - Employee Number (for reference)
   - Start Date
   - End Date
   - Working Days (decimal with 2 decimal places)
   - Import Batch ID (to group records from the same import)
   - Imported By (user ID who performed the import)
   - Imported At (timestamp of import)
   - Status (enum: 'Active', 'Superseded', 'Deleted')
3. WHEN a DTR record is imported THEN it SHALL NOT directly update the `payroll_items.working_days` field
4. WHEN payroll is processed THEN the system SHALL read working days from the `dtr_records` table and populate `payroll_items.working_days`
5. IF multiple DTR imports exist for the same employee and period THEN the system SHALL use the most recent active record

   - Warning Records (count of records with warnings)
   - Imported By (user ID)
   - Imported At (timestamp)
   - Status (enum: 'Completed', 'Partial', 'Failed')
   - Error Log (JSON containing all errors and warnings)
3. WHEN the admin views a payroll period THEN the system SHALL display a history of all DTR imports for that period
4. WHEN viewing import history THEN the system SHALL show:
