# Payroll Module Workflow Analysis & Implementation Design

## Overview

This design document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive payroll management system within the existing Employee Management System (EMS). The payroll module introduces structured workflows for managing payroll periods, allowances, deductions, and payment processing while maintaining audit trails and compliance with organizational requirements.

The payroll system integrates seamlessly with existing employee data, leveraging current salary information and employment status to automate payroll calculations while providing flexibility for manual adjustments and administrative oversight.

## Architecture

### System Integration Approach

The payroll module extends the existing EMS architecture by introducing new data models, controllers, and services that interact with current employee and user management systems. The design maintains architectural consistency with the existing Express.js backend and React frontend structure.

## Business Logic Layer

### Payroll Period Management

#### Period Creation Workflow

1. **Input Validation**
   - Verify year and month are valid
   - Ensure period_number is 1 or 2
   - Validate date ranges are logical (start_date < end_date < pay_date)
   - Check for existing periods with same year/month/period_number

2. **Date Consistency Checks**
   - Ensure start_date and end_date align with specified month
   - Verify pay_date is after end_date
   - Validate no overlapping periods exist

3. **Period Creation**
   - Set initial status to 'Draft'
   - Record creating administrator
   - Generate audit log entry

#### Period Status Transitions

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft : Create Period
    Draft --> Processing : Begin Payroll Processing
    Processing --> Completed : Finalize Period
    Completed --> Paid : Mark as Paid
    Processing --> Draft : Reopen Period
    Completed --> Processing : Reopen Period
    
    Draft : Admin can modify period details
    Processing : Employees can be added/processed
    Completed : Period locked, no modifications
    Paid : Final state, audit only
```

### Payroll Calculation Engine

#### Base Pay Calculation Strategy

The calculation engine determines base pay using a standardized approach:

1. **Daily Rate Determination**
   - Use employee's current_daily_rate if available
   - Calculate from current_monthly_salary ÷ 22 if daily rate missing
   - Apply validation to ensure rate consistency

2. **Working Days Processing**
   - Accept administrator input for working days per employee
   - Default to system setting (typically 22 days) with manual override capability
   - Support partial day entries (decimals) for pro-rated calculations

3. **Base Pay Formula**
   ```
   basic_pay = daily_rate × working_days
   ```

#### Allowance Processing Algorithm

1. **Type Resolution**
   - Retrieve applicable allowance types for employee
   - Check for employee-specific overrides within effective date ranges
   - Apply frequency filters (monthly allowances for monthly periods)

2. **Amount Calculation**
   - **Fixed**: Use configured or override amount directly
   - **Percentage**: Calculate as percentage of basic_pay or monthly_salary
   - **Formula**: Apply custom calculation logic based on employee data

3. **Prorating Logic**
   - Apply proportional calculations for partial periods
   - Consider effective dates for mid-period changes
   - Handle special cases (new hires, separations)

#### Deduction Processing Algorithm

1. **Mandatory Deduction Application**
   - Automatically apply all mandatory deductions
   - Use employee overrides where applicable
   - Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements

2. **Optional Deduction Processing**
   - Apply based on employee enrollment or configuration
   - Respect effective date ranges
   - Handle conditional deductions based on salary thresholds

3. **Calculation Methods**
   - **Fixed**: Direct amount application
   - **Percentage**: Calculate against gross pay or basic pay
   - **Formula**: Apply complex calculation rules

#### Net Pay Computation

```
net_pay = basic_pay + total_allowances - total_deductions
```

**Validation Rules**:
- Net pay cannot be negative (system warning)
- Minimum wage compliance checks
- Maximum deduction percentage limits

### Employee Processing Workflow

#### Bulk Employee Processing

1. **Employee Selection**
   - Filter active employees for the period
   - Provide selection interface (individual, filtered groups, all)
   - Validate employment status and effective dates

2. **Working Days Input**
   - Present default working days from system settings
   - Allow per-employee adjustments
   - Support bulk update capabilities

3. **Processing Execution**
   - Calculate payroll items in batch
   - Generate detailed line items for each employee
   - Update processing status and timestamps
   - Create comprehensive audit trail

#### Individual Employee Adjustments

1. **Working Days Modification**
   - Allow post-processing changes to working days
   - Trigger automatic recalculation of all amounts
   - Maintain history of changes in audit logs

2. **Allowance/Deduction Overrides**
   - Support one-time adjustments for specific periods
   - Create adjustment line items with clear descriptions
   - Require administrative approval for significant changes

3. **Manual Adjustments**
   - Support custom line items for special circumstances
   - Require description and justification
   - Include approval workflow for audit compliance
