# rules.md

Always analyze the entire project by reviewing backend code, database design, and frontend implementation. For the backend, check API structure, queries, and authentication. For the database, review schema patterns, relations, and query usage. For the frontend, describe each page and component, explaining their purpose, data flow, and integration with the backend.

## Guidelines

- Identify the backend framework/language, API structure, and error handling patterns.  
- Review database type, schema design, relations, indexes, and query patterns.  
- Analyze API queries and note repeating logic or middleware usage.  
- Identify frontend framework/library, styling approach, and routing structure.  
- For each **page**, describe its role, data flow, and API connections.  
- For each **component**, explain its functionality, props/state, and UI purpose.  
- Describe frontendâ€“backend integration and full data flow across the system.  
- Highlight consistency, naming conventions, and reusable patterns in the codebase.
