# Excel Import Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem Identified

The 400 error in the import preview endpoint was caused by:
```
"ValidationError: Failed to process Excel file: Excel file must contain at least a header row and one data row"
```

This error occurs when the uploaded Excel file doesn't have the expected structure - it needs at least:
1. A header row with column names
2. At least one data row with employee information

## Root Cause Analysis

The error was happening because:
1. The Excel file being uploaded was either empty, had only headers, or was corrupted
2. The file format wasn't properly recognized by the XLSX library
3. The file didn't contain the minimum required structure for processing
