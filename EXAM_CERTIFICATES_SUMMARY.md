## Installation Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration

**Option A - Using SQL file:**
```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name < backend/scripts/create_exam_certificates_table.sql
```

**Option B - Using migration script:**
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/add_exam_certificates_migration.js
```

**Option C - Manual SQL:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS exam_certificates (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT NOT NULL,
    exam_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    exam_type VARCHAR(100),
    rating DECIMAL(5, 2),
    date_taken DATE,
    place_of_examination VARCHAR(255),
    license_number VARCHAR(100),
    validity_date DATE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    INDEX idx_employee_id (employee_id),
    INDEX idx_exam_name (exam_name),
    INDEX idx_date_taken (date_taken)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

### 2. Restart Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### 3. Frontend (No changes needed)
The frontend will automatically pick up the changes. If you're running in development mode, it should hot-reload.

## Testing

### Verify Installation:
1. Check database table exists:

   DESCRIBE exam_certificates;
   ```

2. Test API endpoints (requires authentication):
   ```bash
   # Get certificates for employee ID 1
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/exam-certificates/employee/1 \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

3. Test UI:
   - Navigate to Add Employee page
   - Verify "Exam Certificates" section appears
   - Try adding a test certificate
   - Verify it saves correctly

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Table already exists error
**Solution**: Table was already created. You can skip the migration or drop and recreate if needed.

### Issue: Foreign key constraint fails
**Solution**: Ensure the employees table exists before creating exam_certificates table.

### Issue: Certificates not loading in UI
**Solution**: 
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API endpoint is accessible
- Check backend server logs
- Ensure employee ID is valid

### Issue: Cannot save certificates
**Solution**:
- Verify user has admin privileges
- Check exam_name field is filled (required)
- Check backend server logs for validation errors
