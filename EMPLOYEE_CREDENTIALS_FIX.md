# Employee Creation Credentials Fix

## Problem
When creating a new employee, the username and password displayed in the frontend did not match what was actually saved in the database. This happened because:

1. **Backend** generated credentials with format: `employeeNumber_firstName` (e.g., `emp001_john`)
2. **Frontend** generated its own credentials with format: `firstNameLastNameLast3Digits` (e.g., `johndoe001`)
3. The frontend ignored the backend response and displayed the wrong credentials to the admin

## Root Cause
- The backend created the user account with a specific username and password
- The backend response included the `user_id` and `temporary_password` but **not the username**
- The frontend's `employeeService.createEmployee()` method only returned the employee data and ignored the `user_account` field
- The frontend then generated its own credentials using a different algorithm

## Solution

### Backend Changes (`backend/controllers/employeeController.js`)

1. **Added `generatedUsername` variable** to store the username that was actually created
2. **Updated the response** to include the username in the `user_account` object:
   ```javascript
   response.user_account = {
       created: true,
       user_id: userId,
       username: generatedUsername,  // ← Added this
       temporary_password: tempPassword,
       message: 'User account created...'
   };
   ```
3. Applied the same fix to both `createEmployee` and `updateEmployee` functions

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. `frontend/src/services/employeeService.ts`
- Changed return type to include `userAccount` information:
  ```typescript
  Promise<{ employee: Employee; userAccount?: { username: string; password: string } }>
  ```
- Extract credentials from backend response:
  ```typescript
  if (response.user_account?.created && response.user_account?.username && response.user_account?.temporary_password) {
    userAccount = {
      username: response.user_account.username,
      password: response.user_account.temporary_password
    };
  }
  ```

#### 2. `frontend/src/pages/employees/EmployeeCreatePage.tsx`
- Removed the frontend's `generateCredentials()` function call
- Use credentials from backend response instead:
  ```typescript
  const result = await employeeService.createEmployee(createData);
  
  if (result.userAccount) {
    setGeneratedCredentials(result.userAccount);
    setShowCredentialsDialog(true);
  }
  ```

## Result
Now when an employee is created:
1. Backend generates username and password
2. Backend saves them to the database
3. Backend returns the actual username and password in the response
4. Frontend displays the **correct** credentials that match what's in the database
5. Admin can share the correct credentials with the employee

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Create a new employee with an email address
2. Note the username and password shown in the dialog
3. Try logging in with those credentials
4. Login should work successfully ✓
