- **Props-based configuration** for different user roles
- **State management** with React Query and local state
- **Form handling** with controlled components and validation

### Type Safety
- **Comprehensive TypeScript types** for all data structures
- **API response types** with proper error handling
- **Form validation schemas** with zod
- **Component prop interfaces** for type safety

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-first approach** with responsive breakpoints
- **Grid layouts** that adapt to screen sizes
- **Collapsible components** for mobile optimization
- **Touch-friendly interactions** for mobile devices

## 🚦 Navigation & Routing

### Admin Routes
- `/training` - Main admin training management dashboard
- **Tabs**:
  - Training Records - Manage all employee training records
  - Programs - Manage training program templates
  - Employee Training - Employee-focused view
  - Analytics - Training statistics and insights

### Employee Routes
- `/training/employee` - Employee training management
- **Tabs**:
  - My Trainings - Personal training records

## 🔌 Backend Integration

The frontend is designed to work with the existing backend API endpoints:

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/training-programs` - Fetch training programs
- `POST /api/training-programs` - Create training program (Admin)
- `PUT /api/training-programs/:id` - Update training program (Admin)
- `DELETE /api/training-programs/:id` - Delete training program (Admin)
- `GET /api/trainings` - Fetch training records with filtering
- `POST /api/trainings` - Create training record
- `PUT /api/trainings/:id` - Update training record
- `DELETE /api/trainings/:id` - Delete training record
- `GET /api/trainings/statistics` - Fetch training statistics
- `GET /api/trainings/employee/:id` - Fetch employee training history

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Session-based authentication** via cookies
- **Role-based access control** enforced on both frontend and backend
- **Protected routes** with role verification
- **API request interceptors** for error handling
