## Core Workflow

### 1. **Initiation Phase**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Employee Separation] --> B[HR Notification]
    B --> C[TLB Eligibility Check]
    C --> D[Data Collection]
    D --> E[Calculation Request]
```

**Steps:**
1. Employee submits separation request or HR initiates separation process
2. System validates employee eligibility for TLB
3. Admin accesses TLB calculation module
4. System collects required data automatically

### 2. **Calculation Phase**
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Input Parameters] --> B[Leave Credits Collection]
    A --> C[Salary History Analysis]
    A --> D[Service Period Validation]
    B --> E[TLB Formula Application]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    E --> F[Amount Computation]
    F --> G[Validation & Verification]
```

**Steps:**
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Total accumulated leave credits
   - Highest monthly salary during service
   - Constant factor (system configurable, default: 1.0)
   - Separation date and claim date

2. **Automatic Calculation:**
   - System applies TLB formula
   - Validates calculation parameters
   - Generates computed amount

### 3. **Processing Workflow**
```mermaid
graph TB
    A[TLB Record Created] --> B{Admin Review}
    B -->|Approve| C[Status: Approved]
    B -->|Reject| D[Status: Cancelled]
    B -->|Modify| E[Update Parameters]
    E --> F[Recalculate]
    F --> B
    C --> G[Payment Processing]
    G --> H[Status: Paid]
    H --> I[Final Documentation]
```

**Status Flow:**
- **Computed** → **Approved** → **Paid**
- **Computed** → **Cancelled** (if rejected)
- **Approved** → **Cancelled** (before payment)

### 4. **Documentation & Reporting**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Paid TLB] --> B[Generate Reports]
    B --> C[Summary Statistics]
    B --> D[Individual Records]
    B --> E[Financial Reports]
    B --> F[Audit Trail]
```

## Calculation Formula

### **Primary Formula:**
```
TLB Amount = Total Leave Credits × Highest Monthly Salary × Constant Factor
```

### **Component Details:**

#### 1. **Total Leave Credits**
- Source: `employee_leave_balances` table
- Calculation: `SUM(earned_days) - SUM(used_days) - SUM(monetized_days)`
- Includes all leave types accumulated during service

#### 2. **Highest Monthly Salary**
- Sources: 
  - `service_records.salary` (historical data)
  - `employees.current_monthly_salary` (current salary)
- System selects the maximum value from both sources

#### 3. **Constant Factor**
- Default: 1.0
- Configurable through `system_settings` table
- Setting key: `tlb_constant_factor`
- Range: 0.1 to 2.0

### **Example Calculation:**
```
Employee: John Doe
Total Leave Credits: 45.50 days
Highest Monthly Salary: ₱35,000.00
Constant Factor: 1.0

TLB Amount = 45.50 × 35,000.00 × 1.0 = ₱1,592,500.00
```
