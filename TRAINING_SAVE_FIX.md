# Training Save Issue - Fixed

## Problem
When adding training records in the Create Employee or Edit Employee pages, the training data was successfully collected in the UI but **was not being saved to the database**.

## Root Cause
The training data was being managed in the component state (`trainings` array) but there was no code to actually send this data to the backend API. The form submission only saved the employee data and exam certificates, completely ignoring the trainings.

## Solution

### 1. Frontend - EmployeeCreatePage.tsx
Added code to save trainings after employee creation:
```typescript
// Save trainings if any
if (trainings.length > 0 && result.employee?.id) {
  try {
    const { trainingService } = await import('@/services/trainingService');
    await Promise.all(
      trainings.map(training =>
        trainingService.createTraining({
          ...training,
          employee_id: result.employee.id
        })
      )
    );
  } catch (trainingError) {
    console.error('Failed to save trainings:', trainingError);
    showToast.error('Employee created but some trainings failed to save');
  }
}
```

### 2. Frontend - EmployeeEditPage.tsx
Added comprehensive training management:

**a) Added state to track original trainings:**
```typescript
const [originalTrainings, setOriginalTrainings] = useState<any[]>([]);
```

**b) Added code to fetch existing trainings:**
```typescript
// Fetch trainings
try {
  const { trainingService } = await import('@/services/trainingService');
  const trainingHistory = await trainingService.getEmployeeTrainingHistory(parseInt(id));
  setTrainings(trainingHistory.trainings || []);
  setOriginalTrainings(trainingHistory.trainings || []);
} catch (trainingError) {
  console.error('Failed to fetch trainings:', trainingError);
  setTrainings([]);
  setOriginalTrainings([]);
}
```

**c) Added code to handle training CRUD operations:**
```typescript
// Handle trainings
try {
  const { trainingService } = await import('@/services/trainingService');
  const currentTrainings = trainings || [];
  const origTrainings = originalTrainings || [];

  // Find trainings to delete (in original but not in current)
  const trainingsToDelete = origTrainings.filter(
    orig => !currentTrainings.find(curr => curr.id === orig.id)
  );

  // Find trainings to add (no id)
  const trainingsToAdd = currentTrainings.filter(training => !training.id);

  // Find trainings to update (has id and exists in both)
  const trainingsToUpdate = currentTrainings.filter(training => 
    training.id && origTrainings.find(orig => orig.id === training.id)
  );

  // Execute operations
  const trainingOperations = [
    ...trainingsToDelete.filter(training => training.id).map(training => 
      trainingService.deleteTraining(training.id!)
    ),
    ...trainingsToAdd.map(training => 
      trainingService.createTraining({
        ...training,
        employee_id: employee.id
      })
    ),
    ...trainingsToUpdate.filter(training => training.id).map(training => 
      trainingService.updateTraining(training.id!, {
        ...training,
        id: training.id!
      })
    )
  ];

  if (trainingOperations.length > 0) {
    await Promise.all(trainingOperations);
  }
} catch (trainingError) {
  console.error('Failed to update trainings:', trainingError);
  showToast.error('Employee updated but some trainings failed to save');
}
```

### 3. Backend - trainingController.js
Made validation more flexible to match UI behavior:

**a) Made start_date and end_date optional:**
```javascript
body('start_date')
    .optional({ checkFalsy: true })
    .isISO8601()
    .withMessage('Valid start date is required'),
body('end_date')
    .optional({ checkFalsy: true })
    .isISO8601()
    .withMessage('Valid end date is required')
    .custom((value, { req }) => {
        if (!value || !req.body.start_date) return true;
        const endDate = new Date(value);
        const startDate = new Date(req.body.start_date);
        if (endDate < startDate) {
            throw new Error('End date must be after or equal to start date');
        }
        return true;
    }),
```

**b) Added training_type validation:**
```javascript
body('training_type')
    .optional()
    .isIn(['Internal', 'External', 'Online', 'Seminar', 'Workshop'])
    .withMessage('Valid training type is required (Internal, External, Online, Seminar, Workshop)'),
```

**c) Added training_type to saved data:**
```javascript
const trainingData = {
    employee_id: req.body.employee_id,
    training_program_id: req.body.training_program_id,
    training_title: req.body.training_title,
    training_type: req.body.training_type,  // Added this field
    start_date: req.body.start_date,
    end_date: req.body.end_date,
    duration_hours: req.body.duration_hours,
    venue: req.body.venue,
    organizer: req.body.organizer,
    certificate_issued: req.body.certificate_issued,
    certificate_number: req.body.certificate_number
};
```

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Go to Create Employee page
2. Fill in employee details
3. Add one or more training records using the TrainingProgramMiniManager
4. Save the employee
5. Check the database - trainings should now be saved
6. Edit the employee and verify trainings are loaded
7. Add/edit/delete trainings and save
8. Verify changes are persisted in the database
