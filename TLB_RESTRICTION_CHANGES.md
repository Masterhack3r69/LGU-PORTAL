# Terminal Leave Benefit (TLB) Restriction Implementation

## Summary
Modified the Terminal Leave Benefit (TLB) system to restrict eligibility to only employees with employment status: **Resigned**, **Terminated**, or **Retired**.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Service Layer (`backend/services/compensationBenefitService.js`)

**Modified `calculateTerminalLeave()` method:**
- Added employment status validation before calculation
- Returns error if employee status is not Resigned, Terminated, or Retired
- Clear error message indicating eligible statuses

**Modified `getEligibleEmployees()` method:**
- Added conditional filtering based on benefit type
- For `TERMINAL_LEAVE`: Only includes employees with status Resigned, Terminated, or Retired
- For all other benefits: Maintains existing Active employee filter

### Frontend Changes

#### 2. Single Processing Panel (`frontend/src/components/benefits/SingleProcessingPanel.tsx`)

**Modified `loadEmployees()` method:**
- Added conditional employee loading based on benefit type
- For Terminal Leave: Loads and filters employees with Resigned/Terminated/Retired status
- For other benefits: Maintains existing Active employee filter

**Updated useEffect dependency:**
- Changed to reload employees when benefit type changes
- Ensures correct employee list is shown for each benefit type

### Documentation Updates

#### 3. API Documentation (`backend/docs/COMPENSATION_BENEFITS_API.md`)
- Added eligibility requirement section for TLB
- Updated description to clarify status restrictions

#### 4. Module Documentation (`backend/docs/COMPENSATION_BENEFITS_MODULE.md`)
- Added eligibility note for Terminal Leave Benefit

#### 5. Implementation Documentation (`COMPENSATION_BENEFITS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`)
- Updated TLB description to include status restriction

## Validation Testing

Created and executed test script to verify:
- ✅ Active employees are rejected for TLB calculation
- ✅ Resigned employees are accepted for TLB calculation  
- ✅ Terminated employees are accepted for TLB calculation
- ✅ Retired employees are accepted for TLB calculation

## Impact

### Positive Impact
- **Compliance**: Ensures TLB is only processed for employees who have actually left the organization
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental TLB processing for active employees
- **Business Logic**: Aligns system behavior with actual HR business rules

### User Experience
- **Frontend**: Automatically shows only eligible employees when TLB is selected
- **Backend**: Clear error messages when attempting to calculate TLB for ineligible employees
- **API**: Consistent eligibility filtering across all endpoints

## API Behavior Changes

### Before
- `GET /api/compensation-benefits/eligible/TERMINAL_LEAVE` returned all active employees
- `GET /api/compensation-benefits/calculate/TERMINAL_LEAVE/:id` calculated for any employee

### After  
- `GET /api/compensation-benefits/eligible/TERMINAL_LEAVE` returns only Resigned/Terminated/Retired employees
- `GET /api/compensation-benefits/calculate/TERMINAL_LEAVE/:id` validates employee status before calculation

## Error Messages

New validation error message:
```
"Terminal Leave Benefit is only available for employees with status: Resigned, Terminated, Retired. Current status: [employee_status]"
```

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ No breaking changes to existing API structure
- ✅ Existing TLB records remain unchanged
- ✅ Other benefit types unaffected
- ✅ Database schema unchanged

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Verify TLB option only shows eligible employees in frontend
   - Test TLB calculation API with different employee statuses
   - Confirm error handling for ineligible employees

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test bulk processing excludes TLB (as intended)
   - Verify single processing works correctly for TLB
   - Check audit logging captures status validation

3. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - HR staff should verify only separated employees appear for TLB
   - Confirm calculation accuracy for eligible employees
   - Test error message clarity for business users
