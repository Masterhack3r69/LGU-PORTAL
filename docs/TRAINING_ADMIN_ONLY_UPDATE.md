# Training System - Admin-Only Management Update

## Overview
Updated the training system to restrict training record creation, editing, and deletion to administrators only. Employees can now only view their assigned training records.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Routes (`backend/routes/trainingRoutes.js`)
- Added `authMiddleware.requireAdmin` to training record routes:
  - `POST /api/trainings` - Create training (admin only)
  - `PUT /api/trainings/:id` - Update training (admin only)
  - `DELETE /api/trainings/:id` - Delete training (admin only)
- Training programs already had admin-only restrictions
- Read operations (GET) remain accessible to all authenticated users

#### 2. Controller (`backend/controllers/trainingController.js`)
- **createTraining**: Removed employee-specific logic that auto-assigned employee_id
- **updateTraining**: Removed access control checks for employees (now admin-only)
- **deleteTraining**: Removed access control checks for employees (now admin-only)
- Simplified all three functions since they're now admin-only operations

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Sidebar Navigation (`frontend/src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`)
- **Employee View**: Removed dropdown items from Training Management
  - Before: Showed "My Trainings" and "My Certificates" in dropdown
  - After: Direct link to "My Trainings" page only (no dropdown)
- **Admin View**: Unchanged - still shows all training management options

#### 2. Employee Training Page (`frontend/src/pages/training/EmployeeMyTrainingsPage.tsx`)
- Removed "Add Training" button from header
- Removed create, update, and delete mutation hooks
- Removed form submission handlers
- Updated page description: "View your training history assigned by admin"
- Updated empty state message: "Your training records will appear here once assigned by an administrator"
- Set TrainingCard to `readOnly={true}` mode
- Removed edit and delete callbacks from TrainingCard
- Kept view functionality for viewing training details

#### 3. Training Card Component (`frontend/src/components/training/TrainingCard.tsx`)
- Updated action buttons logic to respect `readOnly` prop
- View button always shows when provided
- Edit and Delete buttons only show when `readOnly={false}`

## User Experience

### For Employees
- **Can View**: All training records assigned to them
- **Can Filter**: Search and filter their training records
- **Can View Details**: Click to see full training information
- **Cannot**: Create, edit, or delete training records

### For Administrators
- **Full Control**: Create, edit, and delete all training records
- **Assign Training**: Can assign training to any employee
- **Manage Programs**: Create and manage training programs
- **View Analytics**: Access training analytics and reports

## API Endpoints Summary

### Public (Authenticated Users)
- `GET /api/trainings` - List training records (filtered by employee for non-admins)
- `GET /api/trainings/:id` - View training details
- `GET /api/trainings/employee/:employeeId` - View employee training history
- `GET /api/trainings/statistics` - View training statistics
- `GET /api/training-programs` - List training programs
- `GET /api/training-programs/:id` - View program details

### Admin Only
- `POST /api/trainings` - Create training record
- `PUT /api/trainings/:id` - Update training record
- `DELETE /api/trainings/:id` - Delete training record
- `POST /api/training-programs` - Create training program
- `PUT /api/training-programs/:id` - Update training program
- `DELETE /api/training-programs/:id` - Delete training program

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Employee Access**:
   - Login as employee
   - Verify no "Add Training" button appears
   - Verify training cards only show "View" button
   - Verify clicking view shows read-only details
   - Verify API calls to create/update/delete return 403 Forbidden

2. **Admin Access**:
   - Login as admin
   - Verify "Add Training" button appears
   - Verify training cards show View, Edit, and Delete buttons
   - Verify can create new training records
   - Verify can edit existing training records
   - Verify can delete training records

3. **Navigation**:
   - Employee sidebar shows single "Training Management" link
   - Admin sidebar shows "Training Management" with dropdown items

## Migration Notes

- No database changes required
- Existing training records remain unchanged
- Employee-created training records (if any) remain in the system
- Admins can now manage all training records regardless of who created them

## Security

- Backend enforces admin-only access at the route level
- Frontend UI prevents unauthorized actions
- API returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized attempts
- Session-based authentication validates user role
