# Document Notification System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ All Features Implemented

### 1. Employee Uploads Document → Admin Notification
**Status**: ✅ WORKING

When an employee uploads a document:
- Document status is set to "Pending"
- All admin users receive a HIGH priority notification
- Notification includes employee name and document type

**Backend**: `backend/routes/documentRoutes.js` (POST /api/documents/upload)
**Frontend Icons**: Upload icon (orange) for approval requests

### 2. Admin Approves Document → Employee Notification
**Status**: ✅ WORKING

When an admin approves a document:
- Document status changes to "Approved"
- Employee receives a MEDIUM priority notification
- Notification confirms approval

**Backend**: `backend/routes/documentRoutes.js` (PUT /api/documents/:id/approve)
**Frontend Icons**: FileCheck icon (green) for approvals

### 3. Admin Rejects Document → Employee Notification
**Status**: ✅ WORKING

When an admin rejects a document:
- Document status changes to "Rejected"
- Employee receives a HIGH priority notification
- Notification includes rejection reason

**Backend**: `backend/routes/documentRoutes.js` (PUT /api/documents/:id/reject)
**Frontend Icons**: FileX icon (red) for rejections

## Notification Types

### Backend (backend/services/notificationService.js)
```javascript
DOCUMENT_APPROVAL_REQUEST: "document_approval_request"  // To admin
DOCUMENT_APPROVED: "document_approved"                  // To employee
DOCUMENT_REJECTED: "document_rejected"                  // To employee
```

### Frontend Icons (frontend/src/components/notifications/NotificationList.tsx)
```typescript
document_approval_request: Upload icon (orange)
document_approved: FileCheck icon (green)
document_rejected: FileX icon (red)
```

   - Added Upload icon for approval requests
   - Improved spacing and alignment

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing

1. **Check user role**: Admin uploads are auto-approved (no notification)
2. **Check backend console**: Look for DEBUG logs
3. **Check database**: Query notifications table
4. **Check frontend**: Verify notification bell is polling
5. **Check user account**: Ensure employee has linked user account

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Admin doesn't receive notification
- **Cause**: Document uploaded by admin (auto-approved)
- **Solution**: Test with employee account

**Issue**: Employee doesn't receive notification
- **Cause**: Employee doesn't have linked user account
- **Solution**: Ensure employee.user_id is set and user is active

**Issue**: Notification created but not visible
- **Cause**: Frontend not refreshing
- **Solution**: Check notification polling interval (30 seconds)

## Success Criteria

✅ Employee uploads document → Admin receives notification
✅ Admin approves document → Employee receives notification
✅ Admin rejects document → Employee receives notification with reason
✅ Notifications appear in real-time (within 30 seconds)
✅ Notification layout is balanced and readable
✅ Icons match notification types
✅ Priority badges show correct colors
✅ Unread notifications are clearly marked
✅ Delete button works on hover
